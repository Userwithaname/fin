# About Fin

Fin is a font installer and manager for your terminal, which lets you create
your own installers. Installers tell Fin how and where to obtain each font
directly from its source (such as GitHub releases) and manage them on your
system. Fonts can be managed using the `install`/`update`/`remove` commands,
akin to a standard package manager.

"Fin" is a contraction of "font installer".

# Configuration

To configure Fin, create a `config.toml` file in your `~/.config/fin`
directory.

## Example `config.toml`

```toml
# Default location for installing new fonts:
install_dir = "~/.fonts"

# Time (in minutes) until local cache is considered outdated:
cache_timeout = 90
```

# Installers

Fin relies on TOML files (located in `~/.config/fin/installers/`) to specify
how each font should be installed. Based on those files, Fin will attempt
to locate and download the font archive, extract it, and install it on your
system. Note that if the site layout or archive name or structure changes,
the installer may need to be updated to reflect those changes as well.

Supported fields are as follows:

- `name` - name of the font, used for the installation directory
- `tag` - the tag/version of the font to install
- `url` - the URL of the font's download page, which should include a direct link to the font archive
- `archive` - the archvie name, which will be used for finding the download link within the above page's raw HTML
- `include` - specify which files within the archive to install
- `exclude` - specify which files to ignore (takes precedence over `include`)

> [!NOTE]
> You can use `$name` or `$tag`, as placeholders for their values,
> in all fields except `name` or `tag`.

> [!NOTE]
> The `archive`/`include`/`exclude` fields support wildcards.

> [!NOTE]
> In the future, Fin may also support downloading fonts using
> a direct link to the font archive provided as the URL, but
> this is not currently supported.

## Example installer

Creating a file in `~/.config/fin/installers/maple-mono` with the
following contents will allow you to install the latest version of
[Maple Mono](https://github.com/subframe7536/maple-font) from GitHub
by running `fin install maple-mono`:

```toml
name = "Maple Mono"
tag = "latest"
url = "https://api.github.com/repos/subframe7536/maple-font/releases/$tag"
archive = "MapleMono-Variable.zip"
include = [ "LICENSE.txt", "*.ttf" ]
exclude = [  ]
````

## Limitations

- The installer URL may not be a direct download link
- The installer URL must be a page which contains a direct link
to the `archive` in plain text (e.g. it must be accessible without
JavaScript)
- The download file must be an archive - other files are currently
not supported

# Usage

- `fin install` - installs the specified fonts
- `fin update` - updates your installed fonts
- `fin remove` - removes the specified fonts

# Installing Fin

If you wish to try out Fin, you can do so by cloning this repository, and
building its source code using Cargo. The steps for building and running Fin
are outlined below. For more information, you can read the Cargo documentation
for  [`cargo build`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-build.html)
and [`cargo run`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-run.html).

1. Clone this repository: `git clone http://github.com/Userwithaname/fin.git`
2. Enter the cloned directory: `cd fin`
3. Build it using `cargo build` â€” the program binary will appear in `â€¦/target/debug/fin`
4. To run it, either:
    - Run `./target/debug/fin` from the `fin` directory, or
    - Put the program binary into a location within your `$PATH` (such as `~/.local/bin/`)
    so you can run it from anywhere using the `fin` command, or
    - Run it using Cargo:  `cargo run -- [action] [items]`
