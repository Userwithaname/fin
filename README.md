# About Fin

Fin is a font installer and manager for your terminal, which lets you create
your own installers. Installers tell Fin how and where to obtain each font
directly from its source (such as GitHub releases) and manage them on your
system. Fonts can be managed using the `install`/`update`/`remove` commands,
akin to a standard package manager.

"Fin" is a contraction of "font installer".

# Usage

- `fin install` - installs the specified fonts
- `fin update` - updates your installed fonts
- `fin remove` - removes the specified fonts

See the output of `fin help` for more information:

```
$ fin help

    --install-dir=[path]  Set the installation directory
    --reinstall     -i    Skip version checks and reinstall
    --refresh       -r    Ignore cache and fetch new data

    --yes           -y    Automatically accept prompts
    --no            -n    Automatically reject prompts
```

# Configuration

You may configure Fin using the `config.toml` file in your `~/.config/fin/`
directory:

## Example `config.toml`

```toml
# Default location for installing new fonts:
install_dir = "~/.fonts"

# Time (in minutes) until local cache is considered outdated:
cache_timeout = 90
```

Note that you will also need an installer for any font you wish to install.

# Installers

Fin relies on TOML files (located in `~/.config/fin/installers/`) to specify
how each font should be installed. You can find a few examples in the
`installers/` directory in this repository.

Using the installers, Fin will attempt to locate and download the font archive,
and install the font on your system.

Supported fields are as follows:

- `name` - name of the font, used for the installation directory
- `tag` - the tag/version of the font to install
- `url` - the URL of the font's download page, which should include a direct link to the font archive
- `archive` - the archvie name, which will be used for finding the download link within the above page's raw HTML
- `include` - specify which files within the archive to install
- `exclude` - specify which files to ignore (takes precedence over `include`)

> [!NOTE]
> If the site layout or archive name or structure changes, the installer
> may need to be updated to reflect those changes as well.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use `$name` or `$tag` as placeholders for their values
> in all fields except `name` or `tag`.

> [!NOTE]
> The `archive`/`include`/`exclude` fields support wildcards.

> [!NOTE]
> In the future, Fin may also support downloading fonts using
> a direct link to the font archive provided as the URL, but
> this is not currently supported.

## Example installer

Creating a `maple-mono` file in `~/.config/fin/installers/` with the
following contents will allow you to install the latest version of
[Maple Mono](https://github.com/subframe7536/maple-font) from GitHub
by running `fin install maple-mono`:

```toml
name = "Maple Mono"
tag = "latest"
url = "https://api.github.com/repos/subframe7536/maple-font/releases/$tag"
archive = "MapleMono-Variable.zip"
include = [ "LICENSE.txt", "*.ttf" ]
exclude = [  ]
````

## Limitations

- The installer URL may not be a direct download link
- The installer URL must be a page which contains a direct link
to the `archive` in plain text (e.g. it must be accessible without
JavaScript)
- The download file must be an archive - other files are currently
not supported

# Installing Fin

If you wish to use Fin, you must first build it from source:

1. [Install Rust and Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Userwithaname/fin.git`
3. Enter the cloned directory: `cd fin`
4. Build it using `cargo build` â€” the program binary will appear in `â€¦/target/debug/fin`
5. To run it, either:
    - Run it using Cargo: `cargo run -- [action] [items]`, or
    - Run `./target/debug/fin` from the `fin` directory, or
    - Put the program binary into a location within your `$PATH` (such as `~/.local/bin/`)
    so you can run it from anywhere using the `fin` command

To learn more, see the Cargo documentation for
[`cargo build`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-build.html)
and [`cargo run`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-run.html).
